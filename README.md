Contains examples for (deep) reinforcement learning using R, Keras (TF) and OpenAI-gym

<b>Treasure on the right</b><br>
The first file <i>treasure_on_the_right.R</i> and <i>treasure_on_the_right1.1.R</i> are based on python code submitted by: 周莫烦
His github is found at https://github.com/MorvanZhou/Reinforcement-learning-with-tensorflow

<i>treasure_on_the_right.R</i> contains also commented-out original python code.<br>
The idea is simply that the agent o needs to find the target T. in a 1 dimensional world:<br>
o------T<br>
The agent starts on the left, can only move left or right and is only rewarded if it reaches the target T.
